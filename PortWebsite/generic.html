						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>	As a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, my educational career has provided me with experiences that help guide mw throughout the professional world on a daily basis. While outside of the scope of my career goals my undergraduate education has provided me with key knowledge and transferrable skills related to the field of Data Analytics. As a psychology major I aqcuired knowldge about human decision making and communication which are essential components in the presentation part of the Data Analysis process. Ultimately it is the stakeholders who make the decisions, using my psychology background I can be the bridge that helps stakeholders better understand and utilize data findings in order to make important decisions.  </p>
						<p> In addition to my Undergraduate studies I am now completing my Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder online through coursera. Although my path may be unique it is my passion for forever continuing my education that makes me want to learn more about data processing and evaluation every day! </p>

								<h3>Expereince</h3>
								<p>My professional experiences are what have truly led me down the path to becoming a Data Analyst, while refining my carrer trajectory the Public Allies Central Florida program has provided me with hands on professional experience that is the foundation to growing in my career and educational goals. As a participant in this program I was fortunate enough to be partnered with Embrace Families Solutions where I work in the Pathways to Home Division as the Data and Enrollment Coordinator. In this role is where I was introduced to working with large data sets tracking thousands of our clients records and producing montlhy and qaurterly program reports. To make these processes more effeicient and visually appealing I utilized advanced Excel, SQL, and Tableau skills that made our stakeholders more engaged and involved in tracking our monlthy performances.</p>
								<p>Prior to my stint at Embrace Families I worked for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission as the Activities Coordinator and an Education Specialist at the Everglades Youth Camp. These experiences allowed me to get more in touch with myself as a leader and an instructor, and challenged me to become a more organized person and quick decision maker. These are skills that I value to this day as being able to navigate a fast paced and constantly changing work environment is essential to my success up unto this point.</p>

								<h3>Career Goals</h3>
								<p>There are many goals that I wish to accomplish throughout my professioonal career however summed up into three major career goals I hope to... 
									<ol>
										<li>Provide value and growth to any organization in which I am involved in.</li>
										<li>Always continue to learn and adapt to new working enviroments.</li>
										<li>Help to pave the way for other like minded indivuduals throughout their journey in life.</li>
									</ol>
								I believe that through staying curious, continuing to do what I love, and showing kindess and respect to everyone around me on a daily basis that I will achieve these goals.</p>
